# GitHub Pages Deployment via GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy changes to an `index.html` file to GitHub Pages.

## Workflow

- The project contains a simple `index.html` file.
- Every time a change is made to the `index.html` file and pushed to the main branch, the GitHub Action will trigger a deployment to GitHub Pages.
